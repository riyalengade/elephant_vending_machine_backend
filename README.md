## Setting up your virtual environment and installing dependencies
1. Navigate to the root directory of this project
1. Run `python3 -m venv .venv` to create a virtual environment
1. Activate your virtual environment
    * On Windows run `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
    * On Unix or MacOS run `source .venv/bin/activate`
    * To deactivate run `deactivate`
    * NOTE: You will need to activate your virtual environment every time you close and reopen your terminal
1. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies

## Starting the application
1. Tell Flask where to find application instance
    * On Windows run `set FLASK_APP=elephant_vending_machine`
    * On Unix or MacOS run `export FLASK_APP=elephant_vending_machine`
    * If outside the project directory be sure to include the full path to the application directory
    * OPTIONAL: To enable development features run `export FLASK_ENV=development` on Unix or `set FLASK_ENV=development` on Windows
1. `pip install -e .`
1. `flask run`

## Configuring Remote Pis for RGB LED Strip Interfacing
1. Follow this reference: https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/connect-control-raspberry-pi-ws2812-rgb-led-strips/
1. For our purposes, we did not use an external power source and found the power provided by the pi to be sufficient.

## Dependencies for Image Display
1. Image display is done by utilizing feh: https://linux.die.net/man/1/feh
1. To install feh, run `sudo apt install feh` while connected via SSH to the pi.
* Note, this will need to be done on each of the remote pis only, the web server does not require installion of feh.

## Test suite
1. To execute the test suite run `coverage run -m pytest`
1. To view coverage report after tests have been run use `coverage report`

## Linting
1. Navigate to the root directory of this project
1. To check your code style, run `pylint elephant_vending_machine`

## Build and view API documentation
1. Navigate to `docs` directory
1. `make html` to build API documentation
1. Open `index.html` under `docs/_build/html/` in a browser to view documentation
    * The master branch documentation can be viewed on Read the Docs by clicking the "docs" badge at the top of this README

## Running on Raspberry Pi
1. Connect to your Raspberry Pi
1. Clone this repo to the Pi
1. Navigate to the cloned directory
1. [Install docker and docker-compose](https://dev.to/rohansawant/installing-docker-and-docker-compose-on-the-raspberry-pi-in-5-simple-steps-3mgl)
1. Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the containers
    * This will ensure the containers automatically restart in case of error or reboots.
    * To stop the containers, and avoid auto-restarting, use `docker-compose down`
    * Container storage is persisted between runs
